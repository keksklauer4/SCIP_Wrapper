# SCIP_Wrapper
A quick and dirty wrapper for SCIP (MILP solver) to abstract away the dirty details...

Used SCIP the first time and thought it's pretty dirty business (specifically, if one does not need all that extra stuff).
Thus, I quickly wrote a wrapper class for that and a simple example solving the weighted minimum vertex cover using
the MILP solver.

Obviously, this is abstracting away quite a lot.

You can use the code, it's all yours. I do not guarantee anything except for the fact that whatever you do with this, it is none of my business.
Apart from that do not forget to cite SCIP.
